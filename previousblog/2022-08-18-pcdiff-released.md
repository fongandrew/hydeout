I've released a small python library for computing differential operators on point clouds. This is based on work we did for [DeltaConv](/deltaconv), but adjusted slightly to require fewer dependencies and work only with Numpy. Check it out at [https://github.com/rubenwiersma/pointcloud-differential](https://github.com/rubenwiersma/pointcloud-differential).
