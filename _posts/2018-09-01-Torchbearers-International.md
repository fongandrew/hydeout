Torchbearers International has 26 Bible schools around the world. For the past couple of years, I have been part of the Communications and Development effort as graphic designer and web developer. I have created brochures, banners, flyers, newsletters, collaborated on marketing campaigns and developed web applications like an online store and an intranet for alumni and staff.

Most recently, I lead a brand overhaul, which has now been in use since 2017. The redesigned website can be visited at [torchbearers.org](https://www.torchbearers.org).

As part of my work for Torchbearers International, I have helped individual centers create and fill their own websites in a cost-efficient way. Some examples include [Crossroads](https://www.torchbearers-albania.org), [Himalayan Torchbearers](https://www.torchbearersindia.org/), [Portantorchas](https://www.portantorchas.org/), and [Ravencrest](https://www.ravencrest.org).
