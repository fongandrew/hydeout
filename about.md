Hi, I'm Ruben! I recently started as a PhD candidate at the Computer Graphics and Visualization group. My interests include computer graphics, machine learning, storytelling (movies, experiences, books, etc.), and art. After graduating Cum Laude with a thesis on geometric deep learning, I will now work on applications of computer graphics and machine learning for painting analysis under supervision of Prof. Dr. Elmar Eisemann and Prof. Dr. Joris Dik.

I have gathered experience as a graphic designer, filmmaker, and teacher during my undergraduate years. You can find some examples of that work on this website as well.

Don't hesitate to contact me for any questions about my work or inquiries about collaborations!
