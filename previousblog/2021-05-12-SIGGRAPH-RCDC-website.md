The SIGGRAPH Research Career Development Committee aims to foster the growth and diversity of the graphics research community through mentorship, advocacy, professional development, and support. I put together <a href="https://research.siggraph.org/" target="_blank">a website for the committee</a>  and created logos for the <a href="https://research.siggraph.org/cc" target="_blank">Conference Coffee</a> and <a href="https://research.siggraph.org/thesisff" target="_blank">Thesis Fast Forward</a> events.
