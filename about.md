I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at the Oden Institute for 
Computational Engineering and Science, which is part of the University 
of Texas at Austin.
I am broadly interested in developing and implementing computational tools to 
(1) better understand oceanographic processes relevant to the climate
system and
(2) quantify uncertainties in ocean models.
