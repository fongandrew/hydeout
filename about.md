![Ruben >](/assets/img/ruben_toon.png)
I am a third-year PhD student at the [Computer Graphics and Visualization group at the University of Technology Delft](http://graphics.tudelft.nl). In my research I seek to connect computer graphics- and geometry processing techniques to applications in machine learning and painting analysis. I am advised by [Dr. Klaus Hildebrandt](https://graphics.tudelft.nl/~klaus) and supervised by [Prof. Dr. Elmar Eisemann](http://graphics.tudelft.nl/~eisemann) and Prof. Dr. Joris Dik. 

I have gathered experience as a graphic designer and filmmaker during my undergraduate years. You can find some examples of [that work on this website](/category/creative-portfolio.html). Outside of academia, I enjoy [making music](https://soundcloud.com/rubenwiersma), reading and discussing books, watching movies, biking, and playing soccer.
