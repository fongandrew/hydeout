SIGGRAPH is the principal conference for computer graphics worldwide. The Thesis Fast Forward is a unique forum for Ph.D. students in computer graphics to present and broadcast their research in 3 minutes or less. I helped create branding for the event, put the final video together, and animated transitions in line with the Thesis Fast Forward brand.
