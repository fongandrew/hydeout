Hi, I'm Ruben! I recently started as a PhD candidate at the Computer Graphics and Visualization group. My interests include computer graphics, machine learning, storytelling (movies, experiences, books, etc.), and art. After graduating Cum Laude with a thesis on geometric deep learning, I will [now work](/publications) on applications of computer graphics and machine learning for painting analysis under supervision of Prof. Dr. Elmar Eisemann and Prof. Dr. Joris Dik.

I have gathered experience as a graphic designer, filmmaker, and teacher during my undergraduate years. You can find some examples of [that work on this website](/category/creative-portfolio.html) as well.
