I contributed to an exhibition about Girl with a Pearl Earring that will be unveiled on Thursday June 8th. The exhibition contains a giant 3D print and a visualization of the creation and aging process of the painting. The visualization is based on scientific research conducted over the past 5 years. I worked on data cleaning and processing for the 3D print and collaborated with Abbie Vandivere (conservator at the Mauritshuis) and my colleagues to create the visualization of the past colors of 'the Girl' and created the video presentation.
