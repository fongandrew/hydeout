Our paper on [image registration for painting analysis](/publications/2022/09/28/A-New-Baseline.html) has been awarded "Best Full Paper" at the [Eurographics Workshop on Graphics and Cultural Heritage 2022](https://gch2022.ewi.tudelft.nl/node/12)! This work was the result of the Bachelor thesis of Jules van der Toorn, whom I collaborated with as a daily supervisor.
