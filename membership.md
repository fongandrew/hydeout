## Benefits of membership

ISBA sponsors a wide range of initiatives to support biomolecular archaeology, including a biennial ISBA meeting, student poster and presentation prizes, article awards, and workshop micro-grants. ISBA membership helps to fund these initiatives and to support the maintenance of our website, listserv, and social media accounts.

Members also get access to a "Members Only" event at the biennial International Symposium for Biomolecular Archaeology. Membership entitles you to stand for a position on our Board of Trustees, and vote for new Board members. Members are able to nominate their institution to be the host of future biennial International Symposium for Biomolecular Archaeology conference events.

Membership is not required for ISBA symposium registration, however members will receive a discount upon registration.

Membership fees are described in the table below.

| Type     | Cost | Duration |
| -------- | ---- | -------- |
| Student  | £15  | 2 years  |
| Standard | £30  | 2 years  |

## Steps to Membership

Registration can be performed in two to three steps:

1. Make membership fee payment
2. Register your details
3. [Students only] Send proof of student status

<p style="color: #348aee">⚠️ <b>Membership numbers will only be issued once step two has been completed!</b></p>

## 1. Make membership fee payment

Follow these buttons to pay by PayPal. PayPal should allow you to pay directly through your PayPal account, or by credit or debit card (also without an account for some countries). <i>This is our preferred method of payment and will expedite your membership order.</i>

If this is not available in your region, please see below for information how to pay via bank transfer.

In both cases, please note down your PayPal transaction ID or Bank Transfer reference or transaction ID, as you will need this for the second step.
