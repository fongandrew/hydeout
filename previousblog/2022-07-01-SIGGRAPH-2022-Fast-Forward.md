I enjoy creating videos for SIGGRAPHs fast forward that straddle the line between humorous and informative. These videos also allow me to work on my Blender skills (this video: Geometry Nodes, a fully virtual set) and have some fun with storytelling. For SIGGRAPH 2022, I created a video for the paper [DeltaConv: Anisotropic Operators for Geometric Deep Learning on Point Clouds](/deltaconv) as an homage to Jony Ive's product videos for Apple.

SIGGRAPH is the principal conference for computer graphics worldwide. In the Fast Forward session attendees get a quick, often humorous, and high-energy overview of all the works that are presented at the conference.
