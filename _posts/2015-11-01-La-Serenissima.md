La Serenissima is a short film shot in Venice. Originally intended as an announcement video for the theme of a week of celebration, it grew into something bigger when the organising committee came up with the idea to shoot the film abroad. I came up with a story concept, worked it out into a script and storyboard, and filmed, directed and edited the film.
