abstract: "We are developing a new approach to leverage Mixed Reality (MR) affordances for teaching microfabrication processes, such as performed in a cleanroom. Our goal is to design interactive MR content to improve microfabrication and cleanroom training practices. MR presents a promising avenue as it allows hands-free interaction with the system and diminishes cognitive load when learning complex content. We incorporate diverse learning techniques such as real-time feedback, scaffolding, simulations,inquiries, and multimodal interactions to enhance the efficacy and feasibility of educational practices in the design of applications. In a course about microfabrication in bachelor curriculum, we carried out hands-on training sessions in a real cleanroom environment. By the end of the course, five students completed their experiments. We observed that MR was effective in customizing learning experiences and increasing student engagement. Additionally, MR proved helpful for teaching assistants in clarifying complex concepts and phenomena related to the fabrication tools during practical sessions. Although the small sample size limits our ability to draw definitive conclusions, initial qualitative assessments and post-training evaluations suggest that integrating MR into practical engineering education holds great promise."
