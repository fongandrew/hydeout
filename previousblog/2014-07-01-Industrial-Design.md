As part of my Industrial Design Engineering education, I have done several product design projects. These range from shape and color explorations to product designs from concept to actual prototype. Part of the program was to be able to analyze and design the structural and material side of product design, which can be seen in the last image.

*Shape and color explorations for a portable gaming console. The assignment was  to merge two confliciting shapes into one coherent design.*

*This assignment challenged us to combine an existing product design with a different style.*
