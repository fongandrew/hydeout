A 16th century painting at the Catharijneconvent museum in Utrecht was found to be partly painted over: what used to be a gold background with intricate structural detail was now painted over with blue. What should conservators do with the painting: bring it back to the original state, or conserve it as is? Why not both? In this project, a 3D-printed copy of the painting was made and altered to bring back the original look of the painting. I worked on bringing back the 3D detail and pre-visualizations of the golden material on the digital copy of the painting.

The project was detailed by the lead researcher on the project, Sanne Frequin, in the [unveiling of the 3D print](https://www.uu.nl/staff/SFrequin/Extra2) and [on national radio](https://www.nporadio1.nl/fragmenten/spraakmakers/e8fd8081-3002-4e5c-bbe9-21294a4b47bc/2023-11-21-in-hoeverre-kan-je-kunstwerken-terugbrengen-in-de-originele-staat).

We also [published a paper together](https://rubenwiersma.nl/publications/2023/02/21/The-Case-of-the-Golden-Background.html), reporting on an earlier stage of the project.
