Onontdekt is about adventure and exploring the unexplored. Inspired by movies like Indiana Jones, Up, Tarzan and Jungle Book, this short film was created as part of the theme unveiling of the celebrations for the 55th anniversary of C.S.R. Delft, a student fraternity. The film was purposefully cut short: attendees at the unveiling were left to wonder what would happen next and as they started to look around the room, they would notice the globe from the video. Inside it were instructions to go to another location where the theme was officialy unveiled.

I collaborated on the theme unveiling event, wrote the story and script for the video, dressed the set and filmed, directed and edited the film.
