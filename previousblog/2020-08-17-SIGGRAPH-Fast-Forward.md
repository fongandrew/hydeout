SIGGRAPH is the principal conference for computer graphics worldwide. In the Fast Forward session attendees get a quick, often humorous, and high-energy overview of all the works that are presented at the conference. This was my Fast Forward submission for our paper [CNNs on Surfaces using Rotation-Equivariant Features](/hsn).
