Insights from the [RAPID–MOCHA observation network](https://www.rapid.ac.uk/rapidmoc/) in the North Atlantic have
motivated a recent focus on the South Atlantic, where water masses are
exchanged with the neighboring Indian and Pacific ocean basins.
Moreover, the [South Atlantic meridional overturning
circulation basin-wide array (SAMBA)](https://www.aoml.noaa.gov/phod/SAMOC_international/)
was recently launched to monitor
variability in the South Atlantic MOC (SAMOC) at 34.5$$^\circ$$S.
In this work, we were interested in understanding the processes which
generate volume transport variability that would be observed at this
latitude band. 


### The ECCO State Estimate

We made use of [ECCOv4r2](https://ecco.jpl.nasa.gov/products/all/): a 
state estimate generated by the consortium for 
[Estimating the Climate and Climate and Circulation of the Ocean (ECCO)](https://ecco.jpl.nasa.gov).
Importantly, this model is constrained to a vast array of ocean observations 
over the past two decades (Forget et al. 2015) and 
provides a relatively realistic view of the South Atlantic, 
a region which hosts complex water mass exchanges (e.g. Garzoli & Matano 2011).
See, for example, a comparison of temperature from 
ECCOv4r2 and [a gridded Argo product](http://sio-argo.ucsd.edu/RG_Climatology.html) 
in the region.

This shows time mean temperature at 1000m depth, 
where the Argo figure is taken from Dong et al. (2014). 
The match is not perfect, but it is quite close and gives us confidence 
that the model has water masses more or less in the right place.
See Dong et al. (2014) for a comparison to commonly used climate models and
more discussion, e.g. on the importance of having the 
[Brazil-Malvinas Confluence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil%E2%80%93Malvinas_Confluence)
at around 38$$^\circ$$S.


### Sensitivity analysis to uncover ocean dynamics

Another key advantage of using the ECCO state estimate (and the [MITgcm](http://mitgcm.org/) in general) 
is for access to
an adjoint model, which provides a computationally tractable means to 
perform a comprehensive sensitivity analysis.
Here we compute sensitivities of the SAMOC at 34$$^\circ$$ S
to atmospheric state variables (e.g. wind stress, precipitation). 

![adj_tauu](/assets/img/adj_tauu_240mo_withColorbar.png)
Here we see the sensitivity of the SAMOC to zonal wind stress at one month lead time,
where 
increasing westerlies over red regions would increase the monthly mean SAMOC
one month later, and vice versa for blue. 
This figure shows some interesting features worth noting. 
1. The thick band of positive sensitivity around 30-40$$^\circ$$S 
    mostly corresponds to
    Ekman dynamics, where an increase in the westerlies would generate 
    net mass transport to the left in the Southern Hemisphere, and hence
    an increase in Northward surface transport and the SAMOC.
2. The negative sensitivity near the equator corresponds to Kelvin wave propgation,
    where a westerly perturbation would generate a pressure anomaly which 
    travels cyclonically along the Eastern boundary to 34$$^\circ$$S in approximately
    one month. 
    The resulting horizontal pressure gradient causes a decrease in 
    northward geostrophic transport.
3. The patterns largely correspond to topographic features which act as wave guides,
    steering pressure anomalies generated by wind stress perturbations
    to 34$$^\circ$$S.
4. The sensitivity shows that the domain of influence for the SAMOC is quite
    broad, covering neighboring ocean basins on short timescales.
    This result differs from what has been shown in the North Atlantic, where
    AMOC variability on interannual timescales is 
    shown to largely be governed by dynamics confined 
    to that basin (Pillar et al. 2016).


### Reconstruction of SAMOC variability and attribution

Finally, we convolved the sensitivities with historical forcing variability 
from ERA-Interim 
in order to reconstruct the monthly SAMOC variability.
This operation can be conceptualized as a high dimensional taylor expansion:

$$\delta MOC \simeq \frac{\partial MOC}{\partial F} \, \delta F $$

where $$\delta F$$ is the atmospheric forcing variability.
The reconstruction is shown below, providing some verification that the
linearized sensitivities capture most of the variability in ECCO's 
representation of the SAMOC.

![reconstructed_samoc](/assets/img/exp_var_full.png)

The black line shows the SAMOC computed by the nonlinear forward model
(i.e. the full GCM), and each of the colored curves show various reconstructions 
using adjoint-derived sensitivities. 
For instance, the red curve shows a reconstruction where only the sensitivity
to zonal wind stress between 30-40$$^\circ$$S is used, while the blue curve contains 
global zonal wind variability. 
The "memory" axis for the variance explained curve shows how many months of
lead time in the sensitivities are included in the convolution.
For example, a time series reconstructed from global zonal wind variability
with only one month of lead time is computed by "pointwise-multiplying" 
the sensitivity map shown earlier with 
ERA-Interim wind 
variability at one month prior to the given month being reconstructed.


This figure provides verification and hints at some interesting results
we obtained by restricting the 
convolution to various forcing variables and regions of the world (as is shown 
for e.g. the red vs blue curves above). 
Some highlights of the results are:

1. The seasonal cycle of the SAMOC is largely 
    driven by local zonal wind forcing. 
    Because the seasonal cycle in the 20 year signal is quite large compared to
    any interannual variability, zonal winds do a good job of capturing
    variability in the 20 year record as well (see red curve above).
2. Wind stress acts on relatively short timescales and the majority SAMOC variability
    can be attributed to forcing over one year of lead time.
    This is shown in the figure above as the explained variance is quite high
    even when the reconstruction only considers atmospheric variability a few
    months to one year in advance.
3. Interannual variability is the result of a much more complex balance of 
    forcing from various components (buoyancy forcing plays a bigger role), and
    from remote regions of the world 
    (including a nontrivial component originating from the tropical Pacific).
