    <a class="text"><p><h3>Artist, character designer, CRT TV owner</h3>
    <p>If its weird, needs a guide, and sold 100 copies in 2002 I probably love it. Inspired by works like Chulip, Moon, Wadanohara, Nights into Dreams,
       Digimon World, Gregory Horror Show, and every single emo neopet petpage.</p>

    <p>I started freelancing in 2013 creating TF2 and Dota2 merch with Valve and ForFansByFans.
    Back then I also painted backgrounds for OK KO, Eddsworld, Homestuck, and Brawlhalla.</p>

    <p>Nowadays I illustrate and design characters! Most recently the cast of Coruncopia and the mascot for the Square Enix Music channel, Mr.SEM.</p>

    <p>Hire me for art that's "strange yet charming"</p></a>
