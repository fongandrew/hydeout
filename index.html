    Computational Research group for Ice and Ocean Systems (CRIOS)</a>
at the <a href="https://oden.utexas.edu">

I am broadly interested in developing and implementing computational tools to 
better understand oceanographic processes relevant to the climate
system and
quantify uncertainties in ocean models.
